/*
  I'd love to use the new CnD visualization support for Feb 02's model. 
  The trouble is: these visualizations expect any atom to only appear
  _once_. So the way I wrote this model isn't super good for CnD. 

  That said, beware making modeling choices _just_ for nice visualizations.
  Often it's fine and helpful, but double-check to make sure you're not 
  making your life harder down the road. 

  Here's an example. To make a good visualization, I've changed the entire
  data model so that there's an atom for every cell in the board. Now I 
  need to decide where the state changes live: do player marks belong as 
  fields of a cell, or as a partial-function in Board as before? 

  If I make marks a field of Cell, I need to instantiate 9 cells for 
  every board! 2*9 = 18 for a single step, up to 10*9 = 90 for a full
  game. More atoms often means more scaling problems.

  So instead, let's keep the same 9 cells for every board.
